NOTES:
  -If data isn't downloading, try re-installing the neonUtilities library. It updates often and causes errors during the download. 
  -Not much reason to redownload NEON root data from the megapits, as they are not currently planning another sampling (as of 1/26/2021)

-Download NEON utilities package to download data from NEON repository
```{r}
library(neonUtilities)
```

-Download NEON data from NEON repository
-Assign relavent data products a name 
```{r}
loaddata <- loadByProduct("DP1.10066.001", site="all", startdate=NA, enddate=NA, package="basic", check.size=F)

data <- loaddata$mpr_perrootsample
cdata <- loaddata$mpr_carbonNitrogen

write.csv(data, file = "data/NEON_rootsample.csv")
write.csv(cdata, file = "data/NEON_CN.csv")
```
